# FunnyJobPosters

Welcome to FunnyJobPosters! Job seekers, please post the most outrageous, ridiculous, infuriating job postings you've ever seen here.

From hiring interns with 5+ years of experience, to hiring "ex-public servants" with "10+ years" of experience in React, J2EE, Java, HTML, CSS, and mobile app development.

These recruiters should be made aware that they should be held accountable for the content they send out, and they should be held accountable to the potential job seekers at their company.

Any way, have fun!

Send an email to funnyjobposter@gmail.com, or submit a PR.

Happy job seeking!
