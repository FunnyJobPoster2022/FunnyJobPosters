About the job
Are you an iOS and Android developer that dreams of building life-changing apps from the ground up? 



If you're more into coding and results than red tape, then read on…


We are embarking on an exciting journey to create a brand new financial app that Canadians will love!


Your focus and high standards raise the bar and extract the best from those around you. Sloppy and undelivered projects just don't cut it. Thorough, scalable, and on time ‒ that's your work.


Who are we?

Excellent question. WeyMedia is a proudly Maritime company with a simple mission:


Make money easy and fun for everyone.



To do that, we strive to make both moneyGenius.ca and creditcardGenius.ca the best in our space. Although we're a young company, these two websites have already become two of the top resources for Canadian consumers.


Our team helps over 400,000 Canadians per month make the best financial and money-saving decisions by crafting accurate and high-quality personal finance content, technology, comparison tools, and reviews.


We also actively reward our readers through GeniusCash ‒ our very own cash back rewards program on participating credit cards and financial products. Through this program, we have paid out over $2,000,000 to thousands of Canadians since 2022.


(And if that wasn’t enough, check out our Tesla giveaway.)


So if you want to help us make it easy for Canadians to make smart financial decisions, read on…
